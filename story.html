    <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
      
    <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
<p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the <a id="tower">Eiffel Tower</a> (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
    <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.
      <br /><br />
        After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <a id="louvre"><em>le Louvre</em></a>.</p>

    <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
    <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
